4.  Financial Fraud Detection
1. Description / Background
Banks and fintech companies face growing threats from fraudulent transactions (credit card fraud, identity theft, UPI fraud). Traditional rule-based detection fails against new fraud patterns. Machine learning can detect anomalies in real-time to minimize loss.
2. Problem Statement
•	High false positives in current system.
•	Delay in fraud detection leads to monetary loss.
•	Customers lose trust when fraud is undetected.
3. Task
•	Ingest & preprocess transaction data.
•	Train anomaly detection & classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
•	Build fraud alerts dashboard in Power BI.

4. Objective
•	Detect fraud with >90% precision.
•	Reduce false positives by 20%.
•	Provide real-time fraud alerts.
